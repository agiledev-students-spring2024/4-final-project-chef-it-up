# Chef-It-Up

## Product Vision Statement

We want an app that will track specified ingredients for a user to prevent food waste, and give users options and recipes to utilize their stored ingredients to help them use their current items as well as improve their skills as chefs.

## Project History

A common problem for many households is groceries and store goods going bad due to oversight and lack of knowledge of how to use them with whatever remaining ingredients. We wanted to make an app to combat this problem and make it much easier to avoid food wastage as well as get people to try new dishes and be more apt in the kitchen.

## Instruction and Methods

Hit a rock against another rock in a public setting. It would be more productive than trying to figure out how to test an app with nothing currently implemented.
